# LED-to-smartphone-VLC-system

Visible light communication is a state-of-the-art technology to address the spectrum congestion and be insusceptible to interference. 

Nowadays, a lot of connected products are embedded with LED to facilitate the development of VLC. Previous works already have revealed the feasibility of smartphone to receive information from visible light source. 

In this project, a LED-to-Smartphone VLC system are designed and implemented to transmit text information. The system proposed used LED configured in Arduino as transmitter and a smartphone camera as a receiver. Text information are encoded and sent out via visible light in transmitter. 
Exploiting smartphone camera to extract the text information from visible light signal was the technique to implement the receiver. 
The design of the VLC system was proved to be feasible. The result achieved a throughput of 10 bit/s and communication distance of 20 cm without data loss. The design was found to facilitate the user to utilize smartphone to receive light signal as a replacement of photoreceiver which promote the communication between LED-embedded products and smartphone.
